            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In the Year Three hundred and two, begun the Tenth Perſecution, which was ſo great, that it exceeded all that had been before it, not, only in Cruelty, but in Continuance; for it contiued Twelve years. <hi>Euſebius</hi> (who lived at that time) writes of it at large in his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, ſaying, It was occaſioned through the freedom of the Chriſtians, who were come into great Reputotion, and were put in Places of Office to Rule in Countries and Cities; but through their proſperity and voluptuouſneſs, brotherly love came to decreaſe, and haughtineſs and pride got up; and inſtead of Worſhipping of God, an inſolent Authority begun to get up in the Church of the Chriſtians. And at that time the Emperor <hi>Diocleſian</hi> gave forth a Proclamation, wherein he commanded, that all the Chriſtian Churches ſhould be pull'd down, and the Holy Scriptures burned, and that the Chriſtians ſhould be turned out of their places; with other ſuch like things.</p>
                  <p>After that, there came another Order, That they ſhould cauſe the chief of the Church to offer unto Idols, or elſe ſuch as reſiſted, were to be put to death; and ſome were conſtrained to offer.</p>
                  <p>This Perſecution begun as a little ſpark, but it ſpread over the whole
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96752:8"/>Church; and the Perſecution was ſo hot and great, that the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors themſelves were troubled, if not wearied. In <hi>Syria</hi> there was ſo many of the Chriſtians in hold, that rheir Priſons were filled with them, and with joy they went unbound to their death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euſebius</hi> writes, how that many of the Chriſtians had their Ears cut off, and their Noſes ſlit, and others of their Members our off alſo. But they who cauſed it to be thus done unto the Chriſtians, did not eſcape the hand of the Lord; for <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> who had endeavoured to root out the Name of Chriſtianity, did nevertheleſs ſee in his old age, that the Chriſtians flouriſhed; at which he was troubled, and killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Baron.

                  <p>Thus it is evident, that while the Emperors ruled, and had power, the Chriſtians ſuffered, and were perſecuted; but afterwards growing nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and coming to have the outward Power in their hands, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Perſecutors of ſuch as they counted Hereticks, and were rather crueller then the Heathen, as may be ſeen by the Cruelties they inſtict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Proteſtants, a particular Relation of which is at the latter end of this Book.</p>

                  <p>This Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> beſtowed coſt on Altars, dead mens Tombs, bones, and Steeple-houſes; he attributed more Worſhip to Images then ever any did, and wrote a Book of the honour and profit of them, and appointed them inſtead of Scriptures, to be Lay-mens Calenders. He condemned in a Council, thoſe that deteſted Images. This <hi>Adrian</hi> clothed the Image of <hi>Peter</hi> all in ſilver, and covered the Altar of <hi>Paul</hi> with a Pall of Gold.

                  <p>In the year 797 after Chriſt, <hi>Alchwin</hi> (School-Maſter to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great in his Letter to the ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> who was a Romiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and had ordained Tythes to be paid) wrote touching the Exaction of Tythes, which he calls <hi>Jugum decimarum,</hi> that is, The Yoke of Tenths, and Exaction of ſomething from every houſe of the <hi>Huns</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> who were but then lately conquered by the ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> and had newly made profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith. And the ſaid <hi>Alchwin</hi> further adviſed in his Letter for the Chriſtian Cauſe, to omit it amongſt them, and not to put the yoke of Tythes (as he ſaid) upon the people, and not to exact ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from every houſe, but to ſhew that we are the Apoſtles ſent of God and Chriſt into the world to preach; and rather to give to them that ask or want, then to exact Tythes; for it is better to loſe them, then to deſtroy the peoples faith. <hi>See Seldens Hiſtory of Tythes.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Edgar</hi> was of a vicious life, favourable to the Monks, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plac'd the marryed Prieſts, and brought in Monks of ſingle life to poſſeſs their places; he built and prepared ſeveral Monaſteries and Nunneries.

                     <hi>Canutus</hi> alſo the firſt <hi>Daniſh</hi> King, who being guilty of the blood of <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Edmund,</hi> Sons of <hi>Iron-ſide,</hi> and Heirs to the Crown, about the year 1016, confirmed Tythes, and built the Abbey of St. <hi>Bennet</hi> (ſo called) in <hi>Norfolk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus its plain, that Tythes were given for the ſatisfaction of the ſins of the Donor, and to maintain the Popiſh Clergy to ſay, and ſing Maſs, to pray for the ſouls of the Donors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> in the year 844, in his Devotion to holy Church and Religious Orders, and for the remedy of their ſouls, and that their ſins might be remitted, he gave the Tythe of all his Goods and Lands in <hi>Weſt-Saxony,</hi> with liberty and freedom from all ſervage and civil charge, in the days of Pope <hi>Jone,</hi> which Pope fell in labour as ſhe was going a Proceſſion, (and died) being accompanied with Cardinals, Patriarchs, Arch-Biſhops, Bi-Deacons, Monks, Fryars and Nuns.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> about the year 1110, a Council being held in his time by his order, it was decreed, that it ſhould be Hereſie for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to deny obedience to the Pope; and made a Canon for paying
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96752:30"/>of Tenths to Prieſts, concluding it ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, to ſell the Tenths; he renewed an Excommunication againſt the Emperor, and thruſt him from his Crown and Princely Title, and provoked his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, and armed him to rebel againſt his Father.</p>
                  <p>The great Decree which ſpeaks moſt plainly, and till which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was given forth which did directly conſtitute them, but rather ſtill ſuppoſed them as due by ſome former right, was made at the Council of <hi>Treat,</hi> under Pope <hi>Plus</hi> the Fourth, about the year 1560; and yet that great Council followed the Doctrine of their Fathers, and ſaid they were due to God, and had no new Authority for their great Decree, which they commanded to be obeyed under the penalty of Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the many Laws, Canons, and Decrees of Kings, Popes, and Councils, and Biſhops, that every man ought to pay the tenth part of his encreaſe, yet was it left to the Owners to ofter it where they pleaſed; which made ſo many rich Abbeys and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries. And till the year 1200, or thereabouts, every one gave their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ythes as their own pleaſure; which made Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third ſend his Decretal Epiſtle to the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> commanding him to enjoin every man to pay his temporal goods to thoſe that miniſtred ſpiritual things to them, which was enforced by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures. And this was the firſt beginning of general Parochial payment of tythes in <hi>England;</hi> and this Popes Decree is recorded by <hi>Cook</hi> in the ſecond part of his <hi>Inſtitutes;</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That becauſe the Popes Decree ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reaſonable, it was admitted and enjoyned by the Law of the Nation, the King and People of</hi> England <hi>being then Papiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding, our Engliſh Parliaments not willing wholly to forget the poor, for whoſe ſakes tythes were chiefly given, did make divers Laws, that a convenient portion of the tythes ſhould be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for the maintenance of the poor of the pariſh for ever. 2 <hi>R.</hi> 15, 16.4 <hi>H.</hi> 4: as the Statutes at large do witneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Pope having brought in tythes, and made a pretended Title by preſcription, ſet up Courts to recover them, which were called <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Courts,</hi> where his own Creatures were Judges.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>England,</hi> being a Papiſt, and believing the Popes Doctrine, as alſo did his Parliament, That Tythes were due to God and holy Church, made a Law that every one ſhould ſet out, and pay Tythes.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:96752:30"/>
                  <p>He made a ſecond Law in his time to the like purpoſe, in purſuance of the former, and great reaſon he had, and need there was for them; for having diſſolved many Monaſteries, after he denied the Pope to be the Supream Head of the Church; and took it to himſelf; which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries had many Tythes and Rectories appropriated to them, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had them in his own hands, or ſold them to others to be held as Lay-poſſeſſions</p>
                  <p>And they having no Law to recover them by, the Popes Laws not reaching to Lay-perſons (ſo called) he was noceſſitated to make new Laws to enfore the payment of them, but ſtill reſtrained the Tryal of Tythes to Eccleſiaſtical Courts.</p>
                  <p>After him, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, in purſuance of his Fathers Laws, and upon the ſame grounds, makes another Law for the payment of Predial and Perſonal Tythes, uader penalty of double damages and coſt; who alſo reſtrains the Tryal of them to the Eccleſiaſtical Courts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So here you may ſee the Papiſts were the firſt that ſet up Tythe, and forced Maintenance, and the Spiritual Courts, contrary to Chriſt and the Apoſtles in the primitive times.</hi>

                  <p>The Arch-Biſhop ſaid, Lo it is certified againſt thee, that thou preachedſt openly at <hi>Shrewsberry,</hi> that it is not lawful to Swear in any caſe. <hi>Book of Martyrs</hi> p. 701. Vol. 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thorpe</hi> ſaid, I preached openly, that it is not lawful in any caſe to ſwear by any Creature, and that by the Authority of the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Clerk asked me, if it were not lawful to a Subject, at the bidding of his Prelate, to kneel down and touch the Holy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Book, and kiſs it, ſaying, <hi>So help me God, and this Holy Doom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I ſaid to them, Sirs, ye ſpeak here full, generally and largely; What if a Prelate commandeth his Subject to do an unlawful thing? ſhould he obey thereto?</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Biſhop ſaid, That a Subject ought not to ſuppoſe that a Prelate will bid him do an unlawful thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thorpe</hi> ſaid, But to our Purpoſe: And I related that a Maſter of Divinity had ſaid, That it was not lawful either to give, or take any charge upon a Book, for every Book is nothing elſe but divers Creatures, of which it is made: Therefore to ſwear upon a Book, is to ſwear by Creatures, and this ſwearing is ever unlawful. This ſentence witneſſeth <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> plainly, blaming them greatly that bring forth a Book to ſwear upon, charging Clerks, that in no wiſe they conſtrain any body to ſwear, whether they think a man ſwear true or falſe.</p>
                  <p>And the Arch-Biſhop and his Clerks ſcorned me, and blamed me greatly for this ſaying, and threatned me with great puniſhment except I left this opinion of not ſwearing.</p>
                  <p>And then I ſaid, this is not my opinion only, but it is the opinion of Chriſt, and St. <hi>James,</hi> and of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and of other Saints.</p>
                  <p>And the Clerk ſaid to me, Wilt thou ſubmit thee here meekly to the Ordinance of holy Church, and lay thy hand upon the Book, touching the Holy Goſpel of God?</p>
                  <p>And I ſaid, have I not told you here, how that I heard a Maſter of Divinity fay, that in ſuch a Caſe it is all one, to touch a Book, and to ſwear by a Book?</p>
                  <p>And the Arch-Biſhop ſaid, There is no Maſter of Divinity in <hi>England</hi> ſo great, but if he hold this opinion before me, I ſhall

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Concerning the Heathen Idolaters naming their Dayes and Months.</head>
               <p>THE old Pagan-<hi>Saxons</hi> in their Idolatry, were the firſt that brought in the Names of the Dayes, which thoſe called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have retained to this day; for they adored Idols, and unto them offered Sacriſices, and worſhipped the Planets. <hi>See</hi> Veſtigans <hi>Antiquities, and</hi> Cambdens Brit.</p>
               <p>As touching the Idols which theſe <hi>Saxons</hi> adored, they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and though they had many, yet ſeven among the reſt they eſpecially appropriated unto the ſeven dayes of the week.</p>
               <p>That day which is the firſt day of the week, they worſhipped the Idol of the Sun, which was placed in a Temple, and there acrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto, and to the ſpecial adoration of which Idol, they gave the Name of <hi>Sunday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond day of the week they dedicated to the Idol of the Moon, and from whence theſe called Chriſtians retain the Name of <hi>Monday,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Moonday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next was the the Idol of the Planets, was the Idol of <hi>Tuiſco,</hi> who was the firſt and chiefeſt man of Name among the <hi>Germans,</hi> unto whom the Name of <hi>Tueſday</hi> was eſpecially Dedicated.</p>
               <p>The next was the Idol <hi>Woden,</hi> whom the <hi>Saxons</hi> honoured for their God of Battel. And after this Idol theſe called Chriſtians do yet call the fourth day of the week <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Woddenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next was the Idol <hi>Thor,</hi> from whence the Name <hi>Thurſday</hi> is retained, inſtead of the fifth day of the week.</p>
               <p>The next Idol was the Goddeſs <hi>Friga,</hi> to which Idol they dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the ſixth day of the Week, and called it <hi>Friday;</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this day.</p>
               <p>The laſt day was the Idol <hi>Seater,</hi> from whence is called the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, <hi>Saturday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as theſe called Chriſtians have ſollowed the Heathens Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in naming their Days, ſo they followed them in naming their Months; for the Heathen they called <hi>Mars</hi> the God of Battel, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96752:36"/>from thence they calleed the firſt Month <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Venus</hi> they called the Goddeſs of Love and Beauty, and from thence they called they called the ſecond Month <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Maja</hi> a Heathen Goddeſs called <hi>Flora; Flora</hi> and <hi>Cloris</hi> were called the Goddeſſes of Flowers; unto <hi>Maja</hi> the Heathen Idolaters uſe to ſacrifice; from thence was the third Month called <hi>May.</hi> And upon the firſt day of the ſame Month they uſed to keep <hi>Floralia</hi> Feaſts to the two Goddeſſes of Flowers, <hi>viz. Flora</hi> and <hi>Cloris;</hi> and <hi>Flora</hi> was a Strumpet in <hi>Rome,</hi> that uſed on the firſt day of that Month to ſet up a May-pole before her door to entice her Lovers: From whence came May-poles and May-day to be ſince obſerved by theſe called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Juno,</hi> whom the Heathen called the Goddeſs of Kingdoms and Wealth; from this <hi>Juno</hi> the fourth Month was called <hi>June;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, in honour to him was the fifth Month called <hi>July.</hi>

               <p>IN the year 1198, <hi>Gaudentius de Mor,</hi> (See <hi>Juſtin,</hi> Part 1. Ch. 26.) proves, that they did of old bury privately their dead in their Grounds; which cuſtom was taken away by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, who decreed that none ſhould be buryed in unconſecrated places; and then after, people began to deſire to be buryed within the Church, out of a Superſtitious reſpect to the Saint whoſe Name that Church did bear, and becauſe their Kindred and Relations did pray for them there; beſides, they hoped to be benefited by the merits of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: And it may be read in <hi>Auſtin de cura pro Mortuis,</hi> chap. 5. That the believing Mother did deſire that the body of her believing Son might be buryed in the Church of the Martyrs, for ſo much as ſhe did believe that his ſoul did reap benefit through the Merits of the ſaid Martyrs. And about this time the Clergy began to appropriate to themſelves the prerogative of taking money to let people be buryed in Churches, and is at this day uſed in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>And on the twelfth of the eighth month, 1658, the <hi>Independents</hi> made a Form of Faith in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and publiſhed it.</p>
                  <p>In which Form of Faith they laid down, (in chap. 13.) that they that are united to Chriſt, effectually called and regenerated, having a new heart, and a new ſpirit created in them through the virtue of Chriſts death and reſurrection, are alſo further ſanctified, really and perſonally, through the ſame virtue, by his Word and Spirit dwelling in them, the dominion of the whole body of ſin is deſtroyed, and the ſeveral luſts thereof are more and more weakned and mortified; and that this ſanctification is throughout in the whole man.</p>
                  <p>Yet in the concluſion of the ſame article, they ſay, That it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in this life, and that there abideth ſtill ſome remnants of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in every part. <hi>Note, ſure theſe peoples Faith is one with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who hold a Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And in chap. 23, they laid it down as part of their Faith, That it was a ſin to refuſe an Oath, being lawfully impoſed by authority. <hi>So are in the ſame path as the Papiſts and other apoſtates from the Truth, are in, for Chriſt ſaid,</hi> Swear not at all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>And the Apoſtle</hi> James <hi>ſad, Above all things my Brethren, ſwear not, &amp;c.</hi> Jam. 5.</p>

                  <p>And when the King came in, and the Common-Prayer Book was again ſet up, how many of theſe Prieſts turned in the Nation, is well known in the Countrys; and ſome of them cryed, They would preach in a Surplice, or a Fools Coat, rather then the Goſpel ſhould not be preached. <hi>Here you may ſee the Turn-Coat Prieſts, which mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more their Benefice, then the Goſpel.</hi>

                  <p>Why did you forſake your Religion in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> time, ſeeing you had burned to aſhes, and perſecuted to death the Martyrs for not joining to your Religion in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time; and in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time the moſt of your Prieſts and People turned to Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>

                  <p>Why, our Maſſe-Book was but turned into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which was in <hi>Latin</hi> before; and now we hear it in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> only there is Purgatory, and praying to Saints and Angels, and ſome few odd things leſt out, and Sacrament and Altar.</p>
                  <p>But Tythes, and Organs, and moſt of our old Ceremonies is held up ſtill, which we firſt decreed; and our Prieſts in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> might not marry; and if there was one hundred or two hundred a year belonging to him, he was to have but forty pound a year of it, and the reſt went to maintain the poor; and the Popes Revenue was the <hi>Peters</hi>-pence, that is Smoak-penny; and when the Prieſts turned to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> then they might mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and had all the Tythes, and Smoak-penny too, and the poor were from that time turned to a Seſſions buſineſs.</p>

               <p>And you Popes and Papiſts, who ſay that you brought over the Bible firſt in <hi>England,</hi> and you preſerved the Bible; think you not that all people ſees you in this? For you have been them that have kept the Bible from people in an unknown Tongue; and though all profeſs to be believers in Chriſt, yet they muſt not have the Scriptures in their own Language; in this you are contrary to the Apoſtles, ſhewing you are dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from them who judged them that ſpoke in an unknown Tongue: And Chriſtianity was planted many hundred years in <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Joſeph of Aramathea,</hi> before <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk brought over his trifling Traditions and Ceremonies.</p>

And others that be not in theſe things. you call Lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Judge people of the Papiſts diſtinctions, which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Apoſtles; and do not you think that <hi>Pilare</hi> that ſet <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> a top of Chriſt when he cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, would not have made the Pope a fine ſpiritual man? For does not the Pope cruciſie Chriſt afreſh? Has he not put him to open ſhame, and perſecuted Chriſt in his Members, and ſet his ſpiritual mens Tongues over him, to watch his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre from Chriſt ariſing, with all his Guards and Inquifiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And is it not ſaid in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> The Beaſt has power over the Tongues, and the Wohre ſhe ſits upon the Tongues, which are waters: So here all may ſee your ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual men are waters. and the Where and the Beaſt has pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over your ſpiritual Function: And doth not the Apoſtle ſay Tongues muſt ceaſe? Then your ſpiritual men muſt ceaſe, and the Lay-people will remain; And none but ſuch as they of your ſpiritual Function, as you call it, muſt meddle with Divine things; and all the reſt that be not of your Orders, you call Lay-people, and ſuch muſt not meddlewith thoſe things which you call Divine, which indeed are nothing but your own Inventions and Traditions, and pelting Ceremonies, which you have not from the Apoſtles, as your Canons mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth; but in this your ignorance is ſeen of the mind of God, Chriſt and the Scriptures. So <hi>Jacob, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> were keepers of ſheep, and <hi>Amos</hi> a Herdſman, and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> a Plough-man, and <hi>Peter, John</hi> and <hi>Andrew.</hi> fiſhermen, and <hi>Luke</hi> a Phyſician, <hi>Matthew</hi> a Tole-gatherer, <hi>Paul 4</hi> Tent-makor. Was not all theſe lookt on as Lay-people by the
<pb facs="tcp:96752:60"/>Prieſts of their Ages? And would not they all be lookt o n as Lay-people by you, had they been in your age, becauſe they were not bred up in your Schools which you have ſet up, and there made your ſpiritual men, ſince the Apoſtles days, who are made of man, and by man, and not of God or Chriſt, nor by him, nor of him: yea, would not you have burnt theſe Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to aſhes, if they had been in your days?</p>

               <p>The Croſs of Chriſt it is the Power of God: This was the Croſs in the Primitive Times, and was for about Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Christ. And then after came up the Wooden Stone, and Iron Croſs; and then the true Church went into the Wilderneſs, which was perſecuted by the Dragon, and the woman was fed of God a Time, and Times, and half a Times a Time a Year; Two Times, Two Tears; Half a Time, Half a Year, One thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days. Then the Prophets propheſied in ſackeloth and aſhes, which is a mournful ſtate, One thouſand two hundred and ſixty Dayes; the Dragon having given his power to the Beaſt, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Saints, <hi>and power was given to him over all
<pb facs="tcp:96752:60"/>Kindreds, Tongues and People; and all that dwelt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth ſhould worſhip him; and the Whore and falſe Church got on the Beaſt, which had got two Horns like a Lamb, and he ſhould continue forty two Months, which is One thouſand two hundred and ſixty days.</hi> Then came up the Wood, and the Stone Church, when the true Church was ſted into the Wilderneſs, which wore the fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, going in white, which is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs of the Saints: Then the falſe Church ſet up the Surplices, as you may read what Pope he was. And alſo you may ſee how the Popes and Papiſts, who ſay they are infallible, and cannot err, how they contradicted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and killed one another; and many things might be mentioned, which is out of the bounds of Civility and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty to mention, which might be inſtanced out of Records of them. But here you may read how all theſe things came up by the Papiſts and others, and never ſet up by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as you may read in the Scriptures of the New-Teſtament. Theſe things which have been decreed by the Popes, were not decreed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which they have perſecuted people for not obſerving, which Chriſt and the Apoſtles did not perſecute any for not obſerving that which they commanded. Where is plainly ſeen, that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Church is a Schiſm rent from the True Church in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles dayes, and to be out of the Power and Spirit of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and their Faith.
